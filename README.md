# Description
Midi Humanizer is an interactive Midi player. You can use it to play an arbitrary Midi file, interactively. The Midi Humanizer does not automatically play the whole Midi file. Instead it lets you play the file note by note. Just connect you Midi keyboard and use it as an input device. Each time you hit a key on your keyboard, the midi file advances one step.
